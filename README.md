• Applied machine learning techniques, namely neural networks and CNNs, to classify phases in condensed matter
systems with high accuracy. Pre-processed the images and extracted relevant features to convert raw pixel data into
numerical representations suitable for model training.


• Obtained a classification accuracy of 98% in distinguishing ground states from high-temperature states using a 100-
unit neural network to classify different phases in the Ising model, successfully estimating its critical temperatures and
critical exponents.


• Extended the application of neural networks to CNNs distinguishing different phases in complex lattice models like
the Ising lattice gauge theory, achieving a classification accuracy of 94.6%.


• Utilized t-SNE to visualize data for Ising lattice gauge theory in the reduced-dimensional space, which was crucial
for determining the architecture for effective classification by the CNN.
